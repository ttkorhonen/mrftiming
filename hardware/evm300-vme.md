### VME-EVM-300 CR/CSR Support

The VME Event Generator module provides CR/CSR Support as specified in the VME64x specification. 
The CR/CSR Base Address Register is determined after reset by the inverted state of VME64x P1 connector signal pins GA4*-GA0*. 
In case the parity signal GAP* does not match the GAx* pins the CR/CSR Base Address Register is loaded with the value 0xf8 which corresponds to slot number 31.
After power up or reset the board responds only to CR/CSR accesses with its geographical address. 
Prior to accessing Event Generator functions the board has to be configured by accessing the boards CSR space.
The Configuration ROM (CR) contains information about manufacturer, board ID etc. to identify boards plugged in different VME slots. 
The following table lists the required field to locate an Event Generator module.

Table: VME-EVM-300 CR/CSR

|  CR Address | Register        | EVG  |
| ----------- | --------        | ---  |
| 0x27, 0x2B, 0x2F           | Manufacturerâ€™s ID (IEEE OUI)  | 0x000EB2
| 0x33, 0x37, 0x3B, 0x3F     | Board ID                      | 0x4547012C

### Function 0 and 1 Registers
The Event Generator specific register are accessed via Function 0 or 1 as specified 
in the VME64x specification. 
To enable Function 0, the address decoder compare register for Function 0 in CSR space has to be programmed.

```

vmeCSRWriteADER(3, 0, (slot << 19) | (VME_AM_STD_USR_DATA << 2)); 
MrfEvgStruct *pEvg;
sysBusToLocalAdrs(VME_AM_STD_USR_DATA, (char *) (slot << 19), (void *) pEvg);

```

### Function 2 Registers

The Fan-Out/Concentrator specific register are accessed via Function 2 as specified 
in the VME64x specification. 
To enable Function 2, the address decoder compare register for Function 2 in CSR space has to be programmed.
